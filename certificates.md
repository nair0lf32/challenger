# MY Certifications

I am not very fond of the idea that certificates are a good skill indicator  
or even absolute proof of experience, especially when they are free, But i think  
they can be useful to quickly showcase what someone acomplished or did.

For the moment I just want to keep a track of my certifications links here...I will only show those I am kind of proud though (kind of...most are free):
