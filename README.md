# Challenger

Challenger (code) is a simple repository to host personnal solutions to hard/complex challenges.

challenges are from multiple competitive programming platforms, but only include the hardest
I could solve. Not all of those websites allowed to review my submitted code (project euler) so I
thought It would be a great idea to keep the solutions I am the most proud of coming up with (kek big flex)
